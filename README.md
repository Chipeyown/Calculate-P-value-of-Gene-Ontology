# Calculate-P-value-of-Gene-Ontology
Calculate P value of Gene Ontology
p value is calculated using hypergeometric distribution model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution)
The calculation is implemented by scipy.stats.hypergeom.pmf package.
pvalue = scipy.stats.hypergeom.pmf(k, N, M, n)

ATH_GO_BP.txt is generated from ATH_GO_GOSLIM.txt by using the follow screening:
1, Select biological process: Column 8 == P (P: Biological Process; F: Molecular Function; C: Cell Component);
2, Remove genes that not in ath.gtf annotation file;
3, Remove lines that GO annotation is 0008150.
